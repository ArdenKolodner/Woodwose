Woodwose is an adaptation of the 12th-century poem <i>Yvain, the Knight of the Lion</i>. The protagonist is the knight Yvain, who broke a promise to his wife and went mad from grief after she declared she never wanted to see him again. In the poem, Yvain's time in the woods is a short interlude, where Yvain's actions are largely inconsequential, but I wanted to expand on that, to examine what must have been going through Yvain's head as he regained his memory.
